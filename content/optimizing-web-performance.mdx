# Optimizing Web Performance: A Complete Guide

Web performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. This guide covers essential techniques to make your websites faster and more efficient.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals measure user experience:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Loading performance
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Interactivity
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Visual stability

## Image Optimization

### Modern Image Formats
Use WebP, AVIF, or other modern formats:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
</picture>
```

### Lazy Loading
Implement lazy loading for images below the fold:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
```

## Code Splitting

Split your JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed:

```javascript
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

## Caching Strategies

### Browser Caching
Set appropriate cache headers for static assets:

```javascript
// Cache static assets for 1 year
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
```

### Service Workers
Implement service workers for offline functionality and caching.

## Performance Monitoring

Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools to measure and improve performance.

Remember: Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
