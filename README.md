      "description": "Brief description of your project",
      "image": "/your-project-image.png",
      "tags": ["React", "TypeScript", "TailwindCSS"],
      "links": [
        {
          "name": "Live Demo",
          "href": "https://your-project.com",
          "icon": "globe"
        },
        {
          "name": "Source Code",

## Deployment

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

**Why Cloudflare Pages over Vercel?**

- **Better Performance**: Cloudflare's global CDN provides faster loading times worldwide
- **More Generous Limits**: Higher bandwidth and build time limits on the free tier
- **Better Caching**: Superior caching mechanisms for static assets
- **Cost-Effective**: More generous free tier with better scaling options
- **Global Edge Network**: 300+ data centers worldwide for optimal performance

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Push to GitHub** - Ensure your code is in a GitHub repository
2. **Connect to Cloudflare Pages**:
   - Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
   - Click "Connect to Git"
   - Select your GitHub repository
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Framework preset: `Next.js`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `out`
   - Root directory: `/` (or leave empty)
4. **Add Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add any required environment variables
5. **Deploy** - Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy your site

**Build Optimization:**
- The project is configured with `output: 'export'` for static generation
- Webpack cache is excluded to stay under Cloudflare's 25MB file limit
- Images are unoptimized for static export compatibility

**Custom Domain Setup:**
- Add your custom domain in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
- Update your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare's
- SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

### Alternative: Deploy to Vercel

If you prefer Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

## Costs

- Domain: ~$20/year
- Hosting: Free tier
